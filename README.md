# Rent_a_car

Welcome to the Rent A Car project! This is a Python application that allows users to rent cars from a selection of different brands: Toyota, BMW, and Ford. The program checks whether the car is available for rent and updates the rental status accordingly.

## Features
- **Car Availability:** Users can select a car (Toyota, BMW, Ford) and check its rental status.
- **Rental Process:** If the car is not rented, users can rent it. If the car is already rented, users are informed.
- **Car Brands:** The system currently supports Toyota, BMW, and Ford.

## Classes Used
- **Car Class:** Each car has attributes like brand, model, and plate number.
- **car_status Dictionary:** A dictionary to store the rental status of each car (whether it's rented or available).
